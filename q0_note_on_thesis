## Motivation

1. The most foundamental question of this paper is to investigate: will CLIP zero-shot?
   - This might be done in a quantitative way.
2. We know that CLIP do zero-shot based on alignment. So we want to know:
   - what does CLIP align to? What is the concept does it prefer?
   - Then, we probably can know why CLIP fails and will CLIP zero-shot from a qualitative perspective.

## Conclusion

1. In this paper, we introduce a new method to determine will CLIP zero-shot
2. In this paper, we introduce a new method to explain the internal representation of the prior knowledge of CLIP model
3.
